### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Antonis, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics with a specialization in statistics and computer science at National Technical Univeristy of Athens (NTUA). My academic journey has deepened my passion for statistics and ignited my enthusiasm for the dynamic field of data science. During my academic pursuits, I have actively engaged with statistical concepts and their applications in various projects, honing my analytical skills and gaining valuable insights. My preferred statistical software for these projects is R although I am comfortable in other essential tools such as Python, SPSS, and Microsoft Office.
