### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Antonis, a graduate of Applied Mathematics with a specialization in Statistics and Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). My academic journey has deepened my passion for statistics and fostered my enthusiasm for the dynamic field of data science & analytics. Throughout my studies, I actively engaged in statistical concepts and their applications through various projects, which honed my analytical skills and provided valuable insights into real-world problem-solving.

I specialize in Python for statistical analysis and data science projects but am also proficient in other essential tools, including R, SQL, PowerBI. As I transition into my professional career, I am eager to apply my expertise in data science to solve complex challenges, derive actionable insights, and contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.
